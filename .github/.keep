Introduce the Core Problem Your Software Solves

#### Simplify Complex Problems
1. **Analogies and Metaphors**: Relate your problem to something familiar. For example, if your software corrects inefficiencies in data processing, you could explain it as a line of an assembly factory.
2. **Visual Aids:** Charts, graphs, and infographics can be used to condense heavy data into visuals that easily can be processed. Sometimes a relationship or trend is too hard to explain with words, but it easily may be conveyed with the help of a picture.
3. **Storytelling:** Place the problem within a real context or case study. On a personal level, stories or anecdotes in regard to the issue at hand make it much more relatable and memorable.
